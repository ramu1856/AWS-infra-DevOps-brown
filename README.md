# AWS Infra DevOps Project â€“ Brown & Brown

This project demonstrates infrastructure automation using *Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and Nexus, based on my real-time work experience at **Brown & Brown Insurance*.

It includes:
- Provisioning of AWS EC2 instances using Terraform
- Bash script to deploy applications to EC2
- Ansible roles for configuration management
- YAML pipelines for CI/CD using Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions
- Kubernetes YAMLs for future container orchestration setup
